# Python + SQL Data Analytics Project

## 📊 Overview

This is an **end-to-end data analytics project** using **Python** and **SQL Server**, demonstrating a complete data pipeline from **data collection** to **insight generation**.

I start by using the **Kaggle API** to fetch the dataset, then perform **data cleaning and transformation** using `pandas`. The cleaned data is loaded into **SQL Server**, where i use **SQL queries** to explore the data and answer insightful business questions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python (pandas, sqlalchemy)
- 🗃️ SQL Server
- 📡 Kaggle API
- 📁 Jupyter Notebook
- 💻 SQL Management Studio


## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. **Download dataset** from Kaggle using API.
2. **Data exploration and preprocessing** with `pandas`.
3. **Load cleaned data into SQL Server**.
4. **Perform SQL analysis** to answer business questions.
5. **Visualize or export results** as needed.
